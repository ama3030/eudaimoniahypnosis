              Arno has been trained and mentored by Atlanta's top Hypnotherapist, Sean Wheeler, and has trained with Richard Bandler- who many consider to be the World's Greatest Hypnotist. He has also been trained by the NLP Center of Atlanta.</b>

              Arno's own struggles with clinical depression, severe anxiety, and negative thought patterns led him on a journey in which he discovered hypnosis and the power it has to change people's lives. When he was in NYC in 2018, he decided to be skeptical about his own skepticism- believing that his belief about hypnosis may have been what is called a limiting belief. A limiting belief is a belief that can prevent one from having an experience that might be worth having. He had felt like he was stuck in life and decided to get hypnotized for success. So he decided to go to see a professional hypnotist. During his session he went unconscious for fifty minutes, but he didn't really question it too much. Afterwards, he went back to school and finished his degree in Philosophy at Georgia State University. During the 2020 pandemic, he started feeling his depression return along with anxiety and fear. It was then that he decided to see Sean Wheeler, who later became his mentor...
                
            </p>
              <p>Using hypnosis and NLP, Arno has learned how to control and re-program his own mind to live a life worth living. Now, as a Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, he is doing the same for others. To help them take control of their lives again- to live their dreams, and to see the beauty and love that exists in the world all around us. Arno truly believes that we deserve to live healthy, happy, and flourishing lives. Stop the unnecessary suffering and start transforming your life today.
